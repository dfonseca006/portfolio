	<h2>About Danny</h2>
	<p class = "align-justify">After graduating college from the University of California, Davis, I was very passionate in the Microbiology world where I started my career as a Bacteriologist for a tomato processing plant. Here is where I found that I loved worked in the manufacturing environment due to the many hats you wear and the option to move across different roles. This lead to my eventual path from tomatos, to beer, and now tacos!</p>
  <p class = "align-justify">As a student at Thinkful, I have begun my journey to persuing my other passion which is software engineering. My thirst for coding was first satiated after taking a Python course in college.</p>
  <p class= "align-justify"> If you are looking to bring me under your wing as a new developer in training, please reach out! I am excited to work with other developers who are either experienced or new to build great software. </p>
